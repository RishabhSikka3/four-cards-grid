## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox for layout
- CSS Grid for responsive card layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project reinforced my understanding of layout composition using Flexbox and Grid, and clarified when to use `grid-auto-rows`, `flex: 1`, and `box-shadow` for visual styling. I also dealt with a few layout edge cases:

- Ensuring `line-height` cascades properly from body to child elements
- Avoiding top shadows using this approach:
- Aligning images inside a flex column to the bottom using `margin-top: auto`

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve accessibility with better alt text and focus indicators
- Use utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind for faster development
- Explore more on component-based styling with CSS-in-JS
